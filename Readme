  PS2VFS 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The PS2VFS is an io driver that slots into the PS2 IO subsystem plus a java server at pc side
it provides filesystem access from your ps2 to your remote pc.

PS2 SIDE
--------

You will need ps2ip, ps2eth and ps2ips if you want send directly command without ps2vfs driver.

You must change your configuration network(ip,gw,netmask) in ee/ps2vfs/main.c and iop/ps2vfs/ps2vfs.c
It was tested with last changes in ps2lib 1.9 yesterday.

Copy iop and ee directory in your ps2ip tree

PS2VFS iop module sends/receives commands to java server at pc side with two functions:

  - ps2VfsSendCommand
  - ps2VfsReceiveCommand

  These commands has next sintax:

	typedef struct
	{
		u32 code;
		u8 cmd[5];
	}ps2Vfs_command;

  each function sends/receives these basic commands and some of them sends/receives more data. For extra data it uses send/receive lwip basic functions. 

  It has implemented:

      
  - OPEN  SendCommand          
  code---->number or character of file name
  cmd----->opena string
  - OPEN  ReceiveCommand
  code---->java file id in pc side or -1 when there is an error
  cmd----->OPENA string
  - CLOSE SendCommand
  code---->java file id in pc side 
  cmd----->close string
  - CLOSE ReceiveCommand
  code---->0 or -1 when there is an error 
  cmd----->CLOSE string
  - READ SendCommand
  code---->java file id in pc side 
  cmd----->reada string
  - READ ReceiveCommand
  code---->number of bytes readed or -1 when there is an error 
  cmd----->READA string
  - SEEK SendCommand
  code---->java file id in pc side 
  cmd----->seeka string
  - SEEK ReceiveCommand
  code---->current file pointer position or -1 if there is an error 
  cmd----->SEEKA string
  - HELLO SendCommand
  code---->0 
  cmd----->hello string
  - HELLO ReceiveCommand
  code---->0 or -1 if there is an error 
  cmd----->HELLO string
  - EXIT SendCommand
  code---->0 
  cmd----->exita string
  - EXIT ReceiveCommand
  code---->0  
  cmd----->EXITA string
  
 Commands are received by java server and it executes them and sends response commands to ps2 side
 
 There are two additional commands implemented in java server but it hasn´t been implemented in ps2vfs iop module. Now these command reponses with current directory file name and with a list of files and directories in current directory. If you are executing java jar file in c:\commons-vfs\target, it will be your current default directory for PWD and DIR commands.



  - PWD SendCommand
  code---->not defined 
  cmd----->pwdaa string
  - PWD ReceiveCommand
  code---->number of characters of current directory   
  cmd----->PWDAA string
  - DIR SendCommand
  code---->not defined 
  cmd----->diraa string
  - DIR ReceiveCommand
  code---->number of entries in current directory   
  cmd----->DIRAA string
  

JAVA SIDE
---------

If you want to use ps2vfs java server, you must compile it fisrt. 


1. Download java sdk 1.4.x from java.sun.com
2. Install java sdk and define JAVA_HOME enviroment variable. Example if you install jdk in c:\jdk1.4.x JAVA_HOME=c:\jdk1.4.x
3. To check if it was installed correctly execute 

	java -version

   you get something like this:

	java version "1.4.0"
	Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.0-b92)
	Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.0-b92, mixed mode)
4. Download jakarta ant binaries from http://ant.apache.org/ . It is like a make utility in c but very very powerfull
5. Define ANT_HOME enviroment variable to your ant directory
6. Add ANT_HOME/bin to your path
7. To check if ant was installed correctly execute

	ant

   you get something like this;

	Buildfile: build.xml does not exist!
	Build failed

8. Download jakarta commons vfs sources from http://cvs.apache.org/builds/jakarta-commons/nightly/commons-vfs/
9. Decompress common-vfs sources, you will see a build.xml file inside. This file is like a Makefile. If you run ant now it try to compile it. 
   It will try connect for download some jar (java libraries) if you don't want use this feature you can download commons-vfs binaries. You will need:

	ant-1.5.jar
	ant-optional-1.5.jar
	commons-httpclient-2.0-alpha2.jar
	commons-logging-1.0.jar
	commmons-net-1.0.0
	jcifs-0.7.0b5.jar
	jsch-0.1.0.jar
	junit-3.9.1.jar
	webdavlib-20030224.jar
	xml-api-2.0.0.jar
10. When you compile with ant commons-vfs it create a directory structure like this:

	commons-vfs---
		     |
		     |__ target__
		                 |
			         |___classes
				 |
				 |___lib(place here all that jars)
				 |
				 |___test-classes
				 |
				 |___test-reports
				 |
				 |__commons-vfs-1.0-dev.jar (it will be our final binary file)
				 |
				 |__META-INF

11. Copy ps2vfs java directory tree in commons-vfs src directory 
12. Overwrite build.xml with ps2vfs build.xml
13. Run ant
	you must view something like this

	Buildfile: build.xml

	init:

	get-deps:
	
	compile:

	jar:
	[jar] Building jar: C:\commons-vfs\target\ps2vfs.jar

	BUILD SUCCESSFUL
	Total time: 2 seconds

14. Now you will have a new jar in target directory 
15. To run it go to target directory an execute java -jar ps2vfs.jar and you will see something like this

Server listening in port 6969

16. Now server is ready to listen 

I know that all this step are not easy if you don't kwow anything about java, but it's you have problem i'll try help you



 TODO list:
 ---------

- add more commands 
- integrate ps2dns support in ps2vfs iop module
- improve support for jakarta vfs api. Now it is only used for PWD and DIR commands. There are more providers like smb, tftp, ftp, http, etc.
- add gui to java server
- add a clean system log to java server
- make an universal loader based in ps2vfs
- integrate ps2vfs in Ps2Reality Mediaplayer


Please send your comments, bugs, etc to:

bigboss@ps2reality.net or post them in ps2dev.org or in www.ps2reality.net


Special thanks
